In my user fortune collection app, it featured a login system for users to properly work with the collection page, otherwise it wouldnâ€™t work. In order to set up a user connection to the fortunes and a collection of their obtained fortunes, I decided to utilize databases. It was doable without databases, but significantly more limited, and by assigning all of the fortunes to a fortunes table, making a users table that would add in a user if registration was successful, and using a middle-man table to connect them, allowed me to manage fortunes to users more efficiently. Originally, I was implementing this via array manipulation, but utilizing databases instead reduced the need of index checking as the array(s) being constantly lengthened via push when a new user is made, and made it easier to assign fortunes to a user, and not mix fortunes obtained by various users.
