When first trying out postgres on pgAdmin4 and connecting it to my code on Visual Studio Code, there was a bug of the code not being able to connect to my database that was made on pgAdmin4. I found it when attempting to test my code and see if I could properly access my database through sequelize queries but it was not working as the terminal shown an error saying it couldn’t find it. I had double and triple checked if my .env file was correct by rechecking how it was shown on my instructor’s .env file line yet everything lined up and I filled out the portions with my database’s specific info as needed, and it took meeting privately with my other instructor to go through various checks to see what could be the problem until he thought of the issue being the question mark I had as part of my password to enter my collection of databases, and upon changing the password to not have the question mark for both pgAdmin4 and my .env file, it connected first try. Really surprising given I was allowed to use a “?” as part of my password on pgAdmin, but due to the issue, I will ensure I avoid using “?” as a password for my future databases, or check the special characters in the password if I use other ones and see if they’re the issue should I encounter that error again.
